    <h1>First HTML Assignment</h1>
  </centre>
  <p>Open Notepad to Write your HTML code in.</p>
  <p>You will also need to ope Netscape or Explorer to view the results. it doesnt matter whether you are connected to the internet or not when you working on these assignments.</p>
  <p>For the first part of the course, you will not be putting anything out on the web.</p>
  <p>When I am coding HTML, I keep both NOtepad and the browser I am using open so I can switch back and forth.</p>
  <p>Once you have opened the page in your browser, using the refresh key in the broser will show the latest saved version of the page you are working on.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This assignment should be passed via email as an attachment. Here is what i want you to do</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save the web page as you are working on it with an .html or .html extension.</li>
    <li>Just before you plan to send it to me, save it with a .txt extension.</li>
    <li>Send me the page with the .html or .html extension and the page with .txt extension as attachments to your email.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reason for this is that depending on your email provider, sometimes the code gets changed in the .html or .htm version. sending me the .txt version allows me to see the original code.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To do your assignment, you should first open notepad. Do a very simple web page using the very basic HTML code so you can test something simple.</li>
    <li>Save it with an .html pr .htm extension.</li>
    <li>Go to Netscape communicator and select FILE/Open page or go to Explorer and select FILE/Open.</li>
    <<li>Look at the result o your code. If it worked the way you want it to you are on your way.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To do this page effectively, I suggest that you look at my powerpoint presentations.</p>
  <p>Specifically look at the first two in the list.</p>
  <h2><a href="http://www.pgrocer.net/">Presentations<a /></h2>
  <br>
  <p>I also suggest that you look at my sample web pages under HTML sample pages. <a href="http://www.pgrocer.net/">Sample - look at the first 6 in the list</a></p>
  <p>When you look at the web pages, you can see the HTML code by going to VIEW in your browser and looking for SOURCE or PAGE SOURCE or something similar. The key word here is source.

<h1>The web page you pass into me should have the following elements:</h1>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <td>H1 for header</td>
    <td>Another header in range H2 through H6</td>
    <td>BR for break</td>

    <td>P for Paragraph</td>
    <td>Bold</td>
    <td>Italics</td>
